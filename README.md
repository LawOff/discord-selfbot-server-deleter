### Introduction
A Discord self-bot that allows you to delete all servers that you own on Discord.
I was tired of deleting by hand all the servers I create, so I used this simple script to delete all the servers I created.

<b>WARNING:</b> This will delete ALL the SERVERS that YOU HAVE CREATED. 

(If you are a dev and you do your weird tests with discord on a second account welcome!)

## Steps:
- Python 3.8.5 or Latest
- Clone this repository
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Get your Discord token: `(webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()`
- Put your token in the script.
- python main.py
